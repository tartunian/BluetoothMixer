# BluetoothMixer

This project is intended to create a multi-input, multi-output, Bluetooth mixer using ESP32 MCU's. The repository consists of a VSCode workspace and two PlatformIO projects, one each for input and output.

When uploading either of the projects to a board, be sure to check the 'upload_port' variable in platformio.ini is set to the correct COM port.
